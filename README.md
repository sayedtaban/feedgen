## Overview

**FeedGen** is an open-source tool that uses Google Cloud's state-of-the-art
Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate optimised Google Shopping ad titles and
descriptions. It helps merchants and advertisers surface and fix quality issues
in their Shopping feeds using Generative AI in a configurable, user-friendly and
privacy-preserving manner.

The tool relies on GCP's Vertex PaLM API to provide both zero-shot and few-shot
inference capabilities on GCP's foundational LLMs. With few-shot prompting, you
use the best 5-10 samples from your own Shopping feeds to customise the model's
responses towards your own data, thus achieving higher quality and more
consistent output.
